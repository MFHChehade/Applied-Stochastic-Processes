# Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) Simulation

This project simulates a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) and provides methods to analyze the simulated trajectories.

## Files

- **dtmc.py**: Defines the `DTMC` class with methods for initialization, simulation, and analysis of DTMCs.
- **main.py**: Demonstrates the usage of the `DTMC` class with a provided example from "Modeling and Analysis of Stochastic Systems" by Vidyadhar Kulkarni.
  
## How to Use

1. Define the transition matrix and initial distribution in `main.py`.
2. Create a `DTMC` instance with specified parameters.
3. Access simulation results and use methods for analysis as demonstrated in the example.
  
## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
