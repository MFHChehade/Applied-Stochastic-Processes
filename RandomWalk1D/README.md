# Random Walk Simulation

This project simulates a one-dimensional random walk and calculates the cumulative average of steps taken until returning to the initial position.

## Files

- `random_walk_1d.py`: Contains the `RandomWalk1D` class, which defines the one-dimensional random walk.
- `main.py`: Contains the main code that uses the `RandomWalk1D` class to simulate and visualize the random walk.
- `figures/`: Folder to save figures generated by the simulation.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` file to simulate the one-dimensional random walk and generate a cumulative average plot.
2. Figures will be saved in the `figures/` folder.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
